            "Date I finished this book" should be "Date I stopped reading this
            book." I kept hoping that it would become more interesting, but, on
            page 180 I finally gave up.

            This is animal behavioural science, not dog whispering, and it should
            be required reading for everyone who has a dog, is thinking of getting
            a dog, or is at all interested in dogs.

            I'd read anything she writes. She's a wonderful writer and I can never

            This was a fascinating book about the psychology of dogs, but based on
            a much more scientific approach than Cesar Millan's version of dog
            psychology.
